General codes for simulating spin system dynamics.

Provided are codes used to measure the two-point spin-spin dynamical correlation functions of spin chains using quantum hardware. To measure such correlation functions, a time evolution simulation should be executed. A Trotterization scheme is presented in these codes. I have done work on different time evolution simulation methods, namely Resource Efficient Fast-forwarding, which you can find a detailed description of in the following manuscript: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06146.

Different measurement schemes are provided, namely indirect and direct measurements.
